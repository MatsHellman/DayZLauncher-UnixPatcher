## Notice

**I am not affiliated, associated, authorized, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with Bohemia Interactive, a.s., or any of its subsidiaries or its affiliates.**

If the patcher utility or patch itself destroys your computer, I am not to be held accountable for you running random software on your computer. 

While this patch *should* be safe from detection by Battleye because it doesn't modify anything from the game itself. That being said, use at your own risk and it *could* change.

## Usage:

1. Download or build the patcher

2. Launch `DayZLauncher.UnixPatcher` with full DayZ installation path as argument

(eg. `./DayZLauncher.UnixPatcher "/primary/SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/DayZ/"`)

3. If you see a success message, boot up DayZ and enjoy!

! **Patch may need to be re-applied after game updates.**
